# payment

## Summary

This Go code is part of a payment system that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides two main functionalities: 

1. `SubscribeForTransfer`: This function sets up a subscription to an ERC20 token transfer event. It takes in a listener, a channel to send the event data to, and an array of addresses to filter the events by. It returns a subscription object and an error if one occurred.

2. `ConfirmPayment`: This function confirms payment by listening to the ERC20 token transfer event. It takes in the token's contract address, the user's address, the expected amount of tokens, and a channel to send a boolean value indicating whether the payment has been confirmed. It connects to an Ethereum gateway, sets up a listener for the token transfer event, and waits for a transfer event from the specified user with the expected amount. If such an event is detected, it sends a boolean value through the output channel indicating that the payment has been confirmed.

The code uses the Ethereum Go client library to connect to an Ethereum node and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It also uses the Ethereum Contract Bindings library to interact with the ERC20 token contract.

The code assumes that the user has set up their environment variables for the recipient address and the gateway websocket URL beforehand.

The code is part of a larger system and is likely part of a larger application that handles payments on the Ethereum blockchain.
